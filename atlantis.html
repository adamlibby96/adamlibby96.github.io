      <h4>Assignment</h4>
      <p>
        Create an open, underwater enviornment using Unreal Engine 4. The
        theme: A Lost City.
      </p>
      <h4>Goals</h4>
      <p>
        Become fimilar with the Unreal Engine. <br />
        Challenge your creativity. <br />
        Add interactivity and flow to the scene. <br />
        Tell a story through your environment. <br />
        Create a focal point or point of interest. <br />
        Push yourself to learn other features.
      </p>
      <h4>My process</h4>
      <p>
        I started out with old fashion pencil and paper. I designed the layout
        of the map and then I started working on the terrain. On of the
        challenges that I encountered was just placing the art assets in way
        that looks natural. Once I started getting the hang of placing them in
        a realistic way, I started to work on the player controller. The
        biggest struggle here was working with UE4 blueprints. I started with
        the player's movement (forward/backward, left/right). Since this is an
        underwater level, the player's movement had to feel like they were
        actually swimming. So instead of just moving the character in the
        direction they press, I actually add a physics force in that
        direction, and since UE4 provides a water volume, the drag force was
        already applied to the player's movement. <br />
        After the movement I did the mouse look. I had two options: rotate the
        whole player, rotate the head joint. I went with the head joint
        because I wanted realist head movement. This was surprisingly easy.
        All I had to do was get a reference to the head joint object and then
        limit the rotation of it. <br />
        We were also required to have triggered events. I made 3 trigger
        events in my scene. The first one was when the player leaves the cave
        and it triggers a plane's physics to activate and it will fall to the
        ocean floor. Then my next one was when the player is about to enter
        the main building, a shark will swim out and hopefully scare the
        player a little. The last one is when the player picks up the golden
        knife it will trigger the end game cutscene.
