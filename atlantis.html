                    <h4>Assignment</h4>
                    <p>Create an open, underwater enviornment using Unreal Engine 4.
                        The theme was a lost city.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Goals</h4>
                    <p>
                        Become fimilar with the Unreal Engine. <br />
                        Challenge your creativity. <br />
                        Add interactivity and flow to the scene. <br />
                        Tell a story through your environment. <br />
                        Create a focal point or point of interest. <br />
                        Push yourself to learn other features.
                    </p>
                    <h4>My process</h4>
                    <p>
                        I started out with old fashion pencil and paper. I designed the layout of the map and then I started working on the terrain. On of the challenges that I encountered was just placing the art assets in way that looks natural. 
                        Once I started getting the hang of placing them in a realistic way, I started to work on the player controller. The biggest struggle here was working with UE4 blueprints. I started with the player's movement (forward/backward, left/right). 
                        Since this is an underwater level, the player's movement had to feel like they were actually swimming. So instead of just moving the character in the direction they press, I actually add a physics force in that direction, and since UE4 provides 
                        a water volume, the drag force was already applied to the player's movement. <br />
                        After the movement I did the mouse look. I had two options: rotate the whole player, rotate the head joint. I went with the head joint because I wanted realist head movement. This was surprisingly easy. All I had to do was get a reference to the 
                        head joint object and then limit the rotation of it. <br />
                        We were also required to have triggered events. I made 3 trigger events in my scene. The first one was when the player leaves the cave and it triggers a plane's physics to activate and it will fall to the ocean floor. Then my next one was when the player 
                        is about to enter the main building, a shark will swim out and hopefully scare the player a little. The last one is when the player picks up the golden knife it will trigger the end game cutscene.
