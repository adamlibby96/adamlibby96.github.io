      <h4>My process</h4>
      <p>
        This project was tough. I was the solo programmer paired up with 8 artists.
        We first started by discussing the theme of our project and settled on a Victorian Era mansion.
        Our next task was to come up with puzzle ideas. The artist left this one up to me since I was the one
        programming it.
        I began my research on top puzzle games and got inspiration from them. The first puzzle is a simple 'Wine
        Bottle' puzzle, in which the
        player will have to put the correct colored wine bottles in their correct spot on the rack. Once the player does
        this, a drawer opens up and a key is revealed.
        The player then goes onto the second level. This floor has 2 puzzles, a wall-tile puzzle that reveals the answer
        to the second puzzle. The second puzzle is rotating the candles on the fireplace
        to the correct angle. Once the candles are rotated correctly, the back wall of the fireplace drops and the
        player can move on the final level.
        This last level is more challenging, the player must find the matches, and light the candles around the attic.
        After all candles are lit, a key appears and they move onto the endgame scene.
