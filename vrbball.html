        <h4>Assignment</h4>
        <p>
          Create a Virtual Reality basketball game inside the Chesapeake Energy
          Arena for the OKC Thunder.
        </p>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>
          Complete a functional VR Game with the Unreal Engine. <br />
          Challenge your creativity. <br />
          Make a realistic basketball game. <br />
          Push yourself to learn different aspects of UE4.
        </p>
        <h4>My process</h4>
        <p>
          Since this was a team project, we needed to discuss roles and tasks
          before we began the project. We decided on the art assets we will
          need, and then we decided how the game will be played and what
          features we should add to make our game unique. I was the only
          programmer on the team so I immediately began figuring out how to use
          UE4 blueprints with the Oculus Rift. <br />
          I used the VR template to start out with and quickly figured out that
          it wasn't what I needed. So this resulted in me having to program it
          with little refrences. Once I figured out the grabbing, walking, and
          throwing, I started to work on the gameplay itself. I wanted to game
          to be fun and playable. So I made it a little easier to throw the
          basketball into the hoop by adding a collider above the hoop and if
          the ball hits the collider, it 'snaps' into the hoop. <br />
          After I finished the scoring, I made the basketball spawner, and then
          I added a nice little feature of a live ball and dead ball. A live
          ball means it can score and trigger other events. The dead ball means
          that it no-longer effects the game and the ball will be destroyed
          after a few seconds.
