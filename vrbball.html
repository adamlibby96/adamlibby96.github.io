      <h4>Assignment</h4>
      <p>
        Create a Virtual Reality basketball game inside the Chesapeake Energy
        Arena for the OKC Thunder.
      </p>
      <h4>Goals</h4>
      <p>
        Complete a functional VR Game with the Unreal Engine. <br />
        Challenge your creativity. <br />
        Make a realistic basketball game. <br />
        Push yourself to learn different aspects of UE4.
      </p>
      <h4>My process</h4>
      <p>
        Since this was a team project, we needed to discuss roles and tasks
        before we began the project. We decided on the art assets we will
        need, and then we decided how the game will be played and what
        features we should add to make our game unique. I was the only
        programmer on the team so I immediately began figuring out how to use
        UE4 blueprints with the Oculus Rift. <br />
        I used the VR template to start out with and quickly figured out that
        it wasn't what I needed. So this resulted in me having to program it
        with little refrences. Once I figured out the grabbing, walking, and
        throwing, I started to work on the gameplay itself. I wanted to game
        to be fun and playable. So I made it a little easier to throw the
        basketball into the hoop by adding a collider above the hoop and if
        the ball hits the collider, it 'snaps' into the hoop. <br />
        After I finished the scoring, I made the basketball spawner, and then
        I added a nice little feature of a live ball and dead ball. A live
        ball means it can score and trigger other events. The dead ball means
        that it no-longer effects the game and the ball will be destroyed
        after a few seconds.
