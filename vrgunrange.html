        <h4>My process</h4>
        <p>
          When I first was assigned the project, I wanted to make a realistic
          game. After some thinking I decided I wanted to do a gunrange; 
          but not just any gunrange... I wanted to do make a gunrange where the 
          weapon interaction was as realistic as possible, and use real world 
          bullet physics as well. After I settled on what game I wanted I 
          immediately began working on the gun interactions. I started 
          with an M4A1 and was able to get the gun to pickup and shoot 
          fairly easily. Then I started working on the magazine functionality and 
          pulling the slide to cock the gun. I started with a linear 
          method just to get it to work. Once I completed that, I started 
          thinking more latterally and settled on the idea of 
          'my code should work exactly like a real gun.'<br />
          What I mean by this is: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              The magazine only knows about its current ammo count, how to 
              put bullets into the mag and how to extract a bullet. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The gun is seperated into a few components, the slide and the gun itself. 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The gun script holds the functionallity for weapon 
                  handling and how to pull the trigger. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  The slide knows it's owner (aka the gun) and it 
                  knows how to pull a bullet from the inserted mag. 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The bullets only know how to be shot. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          So the player can pick up the gun, then when they pull the slide back, 
          it will try to get a bullet from the magazine and pass it to the gun script. 
          Then the gun script has a chambered round (a bullet ready to fire). 
          When the player pulls the trigger, it tells the chambered round to launch its projectile. 
          And then the bullet fires from the barrel at the correct velocity 
          and when the bullet hits a collider, it will spawn a bullet hole object, 
          then depending on if it was wood or metal that it impacted, it makes the correct impact sound.
