          <h3>Lost City of Atlantis</h3>
          <p>
            The assignment was to create an open, underwater enviornment using
            Unreal Engine 4. The theme was a lost city. This was a fun and
            challenging project that challenged my 'art side' of game
            development. <strong>Click to see more details.</strong>

          <h3>VR Basketball</h3>
          <p>
            The assignment was to replicate the OKC Thunder stadium and make a
            VR Basketball game using Unreal Engine 4. I was on a team of 5
            people, 4 artists and 1 programmer (me). This project was
            challenging because this was my first time developing in UE4.

          <h3>VR Gunrange</h3>
          <p>
            The assignment was to make a VR game in Unity3d. This was a (mostly)
            solo project and I was given free choice on what to create. I
            decided on a VR Gunrange.
