        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Adam Libby, I am currently a senior
        at Oklahoma Christian University in Edmond, OK. I am majoring in
        Computer Science and minoring in Gaming and Animation. The plan is to
        graduate in December of 2019. <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discovered my love for programming during my
        senior year in highschool while attending a technical college for
        networking. My professor gave us two weeks to complete a small program
        in Java. This lead me to creating a replica of Snake. Obviously being
        my first time programming, it was the buggiest code I have ever seen.
        But nonetheless, I loved starting with an empty file and writing some
        lines of code and watching the project come alive.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <p class="aboutParagraphs">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studying here at OC I have discovered that I
        really enjoy programming in Unity3d with C#. I started out with making
        a knock-off of an old TV series American Gladiators. I have recently
        found the love for developing VR games. While I enjoy spending time
        programming and playing video games, I love spending as much time as I
        can outdoors.<br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy going camping, riding motorcycles, and
        taking my /*derpy*/ husky, Luna, on runs. In Boy Scouts we always went
        camping. Every month we had a camping trip or some other activity.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was elected Crew Chief for a high-adventure
        camp called Philmont. As Crew Chief I led a twelve-man crew on a
        111-mile backpacking trek. That trip was easily one of my greatest
        accomplishments. After Philmont, I put together my Eagle project at
        our local ASPCA. Our job was to clean out their backyard/junkyard, mow
        and weed eat, and build a few shelves for storage. My team and I put
        well over 150 man-hours completing this project. I achieved my Eagle
        Scout rank in 2014.
