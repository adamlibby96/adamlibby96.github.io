        <h3>Brief Description</h3>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! I'm Adam Libby. I have a love for technology, the great outdoors, and gaming.
        If I am not on my computer, I am either fishing or wood carving. I also have a passion for learning and helping
        people.

        <p class="aboutParagraphs">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Midland, Texas, then quickly moved to Houston. After spending several
          years there, my dad moved us to a small town called Bartlesville, Oklahoma.
          I have spent most of my life in Bartlesville. I have a fantastic family: Mom, Dad, and 3 brothers - 2 older, 1
          younger. I followed my fathers footsteps and tried to race motorcycles, but school ended up taking over.
          I had an active childhood, especially with my 3 brothers in the house. We used to spend hours and hours
          outside. I am thankful that I have such an amazing and caring family.

        <p class="aboutParagraphs">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attended high school in Bartlesville, OK. While I was
          there, I had the opportunity to attend a local trade school where I graduated with a certificate in
          Netwroking. I then moved on to college: Oklahoma Christian University (OC). Due to my time at tech school, I
          knew exactly what I wanted to do as a career: programming. I signed up for Computer Science at OC, and am now
          a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Gaming and Animation. I intend to
          graduate in December of 2019.

      <button class="accordion">Why Programming?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="aboutParagraphs">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discovered my love for programming during my
          senior year in highschool while attending a technical college for
          networking. My professor gave us two weeks to complete a small program
          in Java. This lead me to creating a replica of Snake. Obviously being
          my first time programming, it was the buggiest code I have ever seen.
          But nonetheless, I loved starting with an empty file and writing some
          lines of code and watching the project come alive.<br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studying here at OC I have discovered that I
          really enjoy programming in Unity3d with C#. I started out with making
          a game based off an old TV series 'American Gladiators.' I have recently
          found the love for developing VR games.

        <p class="aboutParagraphs">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy going camping, riding motorcycles, and
          taking my /*derpy*/ husky, Luna, on runs. I received my love for camping from my Scouting Career.
          I also picked up racing motorcycles from my father. This past summer my father took me fishing and I instantly
          fell inlove with it. I also enjoy wood carving, especially around a campfire.

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was elected Crew Chief for a high-adventure
          camp called Philmont. As Crew Chief I led a twelve-man crew on a
          111-mile backpacking trek. That trip was easily one of my greatest
          accomplishments. After Philmont, I put together my Eagle project at
          our local ASPCA. Our job was to clean out their backyard/junkyard, mow
          and weed eat, and build a few shelves for storage. My team and I put
          well over 150 man-hours completing this project. I achieved my Eagle
          Scout rank in 2014.
